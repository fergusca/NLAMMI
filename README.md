# NLAMMI
Project examining drivers of benthic and zooplankton MMI in lakes using the NLA 2012 and 2017 datasets.
Analyses are to support the main model building by Alan Herlihy by 1) estimating HydrAP values (Hydrologic alteration potential) for NLA sites, 2) processing data, 3) potentially running random forest algorithims
